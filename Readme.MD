## _Never Miss a Beat: Web3 Notifications Straight to Your Web2 Device_

Web3 developers working in the Polkadot ecosystem can now emit events from their smart contract and make it available for anyone to consume, even on Web2. 
This is made possible by a system that allows for seamless integration between Web3 and Web2, enabling easy and instant communication between the two.

Moreover, Web3 notifications can help bridge the gap between the Web3 and Web2 worlds, making it easier for more people to access and use blockchain technology. 
By enabling seamless integration and communication between the two, Web3 notifications can help bring the benefits of blockchain to a wider audience and drive greater
adoption of the technology.

With PolkaNotify, you can:

- Opt-in to channels that are already available.
- Set up webhooks in the locations where you'd like to receive notifications.
- Receive notifications via Discord, Telegram, email, or any other platform of your choice.
- Establish your own channel, include the contract, and encourage others to subscribe.
